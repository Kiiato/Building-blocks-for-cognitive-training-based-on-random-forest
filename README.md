the tool needed:
- Keil uvision5
- hardware mentioned above

Only the core code is provided,included all head files,hardware drivers,main.c,etc. due to the limited upload area.
you can learn how to configure basic hardware environment at https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Lx411Z7Qa?from=search&seid=5412121543213395381&spm_id_from=333.337.0.0
